## Features

- **Configurable Merchants:** Comes with several default sets of wares that can be modified, replaced or added to (follow the example template shown in the configuration section below and increment merchant number for additional sets of wares).
- **Tokens & Login Rewards:** Earn tokens for time spent online and redeem them for trader currency! Optional daily login bonus.

## Configuration

### Merchant(#)
- **Name**: (string, default: "Merchant#")
  Name/identifier for the merchant, used for easy referencing and verifying existence when autospawning merchants.
- **Output Items**: (string, default: "-1370210913,1915695899,862477668,429052660,28358550")
  Item prefabGUIDs for outputs.
- **Output Amounts**: (string, default: "1,1,1500,15,250")
  Item output amounts.
- **Input Items**: (string, default: "-257494203,-257494203,-257494203,-257494203,-257494203")
  Item prefabGUIDs for inputs.
- **Input Amounts**: (string, default: "250,250,250,250,250")
  Item input amounts.
- **Stock Amounts**: (string, default: "99,99,99,99,99")
  Stock amounts for outputs.
- **Restock Time**: (int, default: 60)
  Time between restocks in minutes (1min minimum, no option to not restock atm since I completely forgot about that >_>).
- **Trader Prefab**: (int, default: 0)
  Trader prefab ID; leave this blank, will be saved out by the mod after spawning a merchant.
- **Position**: (string, default: "")
  Position of merchant spawn in world; leave this blank, will be saved out by the mod after spawning a merchant.
- **Roam**: (bool, default: false)
  Pace around or stay put.

## Development

1. Run `./dev_init.sh` from the repository root to provision the .NET SDK (via the local `.dotnet` folder when necessary), restore NuGet packages, and produce a Release build.
   - Set `BEPINEX_PLUGIN_DIR` to copy the compiled plugin to a different BepInEx directory (defaults to `/workspace/plugins`).
   - Use `DOTNET_CHANNELS` to override the space-separated list of .NET SDK channels installed locally (defaults to installing 8.0 for the C# 12 compiler and 6.0 for the net6.0 targeting pack). The legacy `DOTNET_CHANNEL` variable is still honored when `DOTNET_CHANNELS` is unset.
2. If you're working outside of `dev_init.sh`, install the .NET 7 SDK locally (the workflow pins to `7.0.x`) before running any manual build or test commands. Verify the installation with `dotnet --list-sdks` or follow the [official SDK installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/install/).
3. When invoking builds manually, run `dotnet build ./Penumbra.csproj --configuration Release -p:RunGenerateREADME=false` so you're using the same arguments as `dev_init.sh` and the README generation target stays disabled during routine development builds.
4. After building, execute `dotnet test ./Penumbra.csproj --configuration Release --no-build` to validate the Release configuration without rebuilding artifacts.

### Release workflow

- **Codex branch CI:** Every push to `codex` runs the `Build` workflow for verification only. These builds honor the version guard in `.github/workflows/build.yml`, so bump the `<Version>` in `Penumbra.csproj` before opening a release PR. Keeping `codex` ahead of the latest `v*` tag ensures the guard allows the build to run while still preventing accidental repackaging of an already-published version.
- **Promoting a prerelease:** When the branch is ready for external testing, manually dispatch the `Build` workflow with `ready_to_ship=true`. That flips the workflow into prerelease mode: it updates `thunderstore.toml`, produces a Release build under `./bin/Release/net6.0/`, and uploads the DLL plus `CHANGELOG.md` to a GitHub prerelease tagged `v<version>-pre`. Use this artifact bundle when sanity-checking what will land on Thunderstore.
- **Version bumps & overrides:** The version guard compares `Penumbra.csproj` against the newest `v*` tag. If you must rerun CI without bumping the version (for example to re-test a build), trigger the workflow manuallyâ€”manual dispatch bypasses the guard. Otherwise, increment the version before retrying so that both the guard and Thunderstore metadata stay in sync.
- **Final release pipeline:** Cutting a release involves tagging the commit on `main` with the final semantic version (for example `git tag v1.2.3 && git push origin v1.2.3`) and creating the corresponding GitHub release that reuses the prerelease artifacts. With that `v*` tag in place, trigger the `Release` workflow, which locates the latest tag, downloads the GitHub release assets into `./dist`, and publishes the package to Thunderstore via the CLI. If an emergency hotfix is needed, you can rerun the `Release` workflow after updating the tag or assets to push an updated build.
